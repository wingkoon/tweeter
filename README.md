# Tweeter Project

This single-page application (SPA) project is a Twitter clone designed to enable users to post tweets with a maximum limit of 140 characters. It places a strong emphasis on front-end development, utilizing jQuery, AJAX, and vanilla JavaScript to handle asynchronous requests for posting and retrieving tweets. In addition, it applies SASS for improved CSS maintainability and incorporates responsive design principles to ensure a seamless user experience across a range of devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
