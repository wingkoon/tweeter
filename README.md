# Tweeter Project


Tweeter is a simple, single-page social media app Twitter clone designed to enable users to post tweets with a maximum limit of 140 characters.

All the requests will be made asynchronously, which will allow us to gain familiarity using the jQuery library to make these requests.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

It places a strong emphasis on front-end development, utilizing jQuery, AJAX, and vanilla JavaScript to handle asynchronous requests for posting and retrieving tweets.
