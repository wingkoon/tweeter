# Tweeter Project


Tweeter is a simple, single-page social media app Twitter clone designed to enable users to post tweets with a maximum limit of 140 characters.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

It places a strong emphasis on front-end development, utilizing jQuery, AJAX, and vanilla JavaScript to handle asynchronous requests for posting and retrieving tweets.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with a focus on Flexbox and Media Queries for responsive design)
- JavaScript (jQuery)
- AJAX for asynchronous data handling
- Node.js and Express (for backend server functionality)
